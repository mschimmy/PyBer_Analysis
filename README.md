# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
PyBer is a ride-sharing company that is requesting insights into the ride-sharing data they collected from spring 2019.

### Purpose
This analysis illustrates the differences between city types (rural, suburban, and urban) and their ride-sharing statistics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. Fares are measured in $USD.

## Results
![PyBer summary](https://github.com/mschimmy/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/PyBer_summary_df.png)
From the summary DataFrame above, we can see that urban cities had the most amount of rides (13 times more than rural cities and 2.6 times more than suburban cities), the most amount of drivers (approximately 31 times more than rural cities and 5 times more than suburban cities), and the highest total fares amount (approximately 9.2 times more than rural cities and 2.1 times more than suburban cities). The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is most expensive in rural cities and the least in urban cities.

The multiple line chart above, Total Fares by City Type, plots the change in total fares in USD from January 2019 through April 2019 for each of the three city types. Again, we can see that urban cities have the highest total amount of fares throughout Spring 2019, while rural cities have the lowest total fares.

## Summary
Based on the results, it is recommended that the CEO of PyBer, V. Visualize, do the following to address disparities among city types:
1. Consider adding incentives for customers in rural cities to increase the total number of rides.
2. Decrease the total number of drivers in urban cities as there were more drivers than total rides in Spring 2019, this will increase the average fare per ride and average fare per driver in urban cities.
3. Collect data on PyBer rider to determine the average consumer type and adjust marketing strategies to target these population groups.
